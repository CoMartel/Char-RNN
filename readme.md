# Text Generation Fun

## Installation

Install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/what-is-anaconda).

	conda create --name tensorflow python=3 keras tensorflow

and activate your newly created environment. 

	source activate tensorflow	

If you want to install Tensorflow with GPU support (which can support much faster training), you can do the following:

	pip install --upgrade tfBinaryURL

where tfBinaryURL can be found on the Tensorflow [website](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux#the_url_of_the_tensorflow_python_package). Alternatively,

	conda install tensorflow-gpu

may work as well.

This is a work in progress. Feel free to make suggestions and/or ask questions!
